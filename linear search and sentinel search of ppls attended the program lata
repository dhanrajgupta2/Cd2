Exp No 3: Write a Python program to store roll numbers of student in array who attended training program in random order. 
Write function for searching whether particular student attended training program or not, 
using Linear search and Sentinel search.

# code of linear search

def display(a, n):
    print(a)

def read(a, n):
    for i in range(n):
        a.append(int(input()))

def Linear_search(a, roll):
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if roll == a[i]:  # Corrected the comparison
            return i
    return -1  # Moved outside the loop

def main():
    a = []
    n = int(input("Enter the number of students who attended training program: "))
    print("Enter the roll numbers:")
    read(a, n)
    
    print("Following students attended:")
    display(a, n)
    
    roll_to_search = int(input("Which roll do you want to search? "))
    key = Linear_search(a, roll_to_search)
    
    if key != -1:
        print(f"Roll no. {a[key]} attended the program.")
    else:
        print(f"Roll no. {roll_to_search} did not attend the program.")

main()

# code of sentinel search

print("SENTINEL SEARCH........")
a = [12, 23, 45, 46, 56]
n = len(a)

def sentinel(a, key):
    last = a[n - 1]
    a[n - 1] = key
    i = 0
    while a[i] != key:
        i += 1
    a[n - 1] = last
    if (i < n - 1) or (key == a[n - 1]):
        print("Found at position:", i + 1)
    else:
        print("Not found")

sentinel(a, 48)
