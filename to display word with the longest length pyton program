Experiment No.2 :Write a Python program to compute following operations on String:
a) To display word with the longest length
b) To determines the frequency of occurrence of particular character in the string
c) To check whether given string is palindrome or not
d) To display index of first appearance of the substring
e) To count the occurrences of each word in a given string



# a) To display word with the longest length

statement = "welcome to DSL lab"
words = max(statement.split(), key=len)
print("The longest word is:", words)
print("The longest word length is:", len(words))

# b) To determines the frequency of occurrence of particular character in the string

string="welcome to DSL lab" 
c='e' 
count=0 
for i in range(len(string)): 
    frequency=string.count(c) 
print(frequency)

# c) To check whether given string is palindrome or not

def ispalindrome(s):
    return S==S[::-1]
    
S="Nyan"
ans= ispalindrome(S)

if ans:
    print("yes")
else:
    print("No")

# d) To display index of first appearance of the substring 

string = "Today is Tuesday"
sub = "da"

for i in range(len(string)):
    si = []
    k = i
    flag = 0
    
    for j in range(len(sub)):
        if k >= len(string) or string[k] != sub[j]:
            flag = 1
            break
        k += 1
    
    if flag == 0:
        si.append(i)
        print(si)

# e) To count the occurrences of each word in a given string

string = "Today is Tuesday and Today is freshers party"
list1 = []
list1 = string.split()
print("Old list is ", list1)

newlist = []
newlist_l = []

for i in list1:
    if i not in newlist:
        newlist.append(i)

print("Newlist is", newlist)

for i in range(0, len(newlist)):
    count = 0
    for j in range(len(list1)):
        if newlist[i] == list1[j]:
            count += 1
    newlist_l.append(count)

for i in range(0, len(newlist)):
    print(newlist[i], newlist_l[i])
